# Vocal Isolation with Signal Processing

## Overview

This project isolates vocals from a full song using digital signal processing techniques such as **spectral gating** and **harmonic-percussive source separation (HPSS)**. By analyzing the time-frequency structure of the audio, the system effectively suppresses background instrumentation while preserving vocal lines, creating a cleaner vocal-only track.

## Techniques Used

- **Spectral Gating**: Dynamically attenuates low-energy frequency bins to reduce ambient and instrumental noise.
- **Harmonic-Percussive Source Separation (HPSS)**: Separates audio into harmonic (vocals, synths) and percussive (drums, beats) components.
- **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)**: Transforms the audio signal into the frequency domain for analysis and processing.

## Tools & Libraries

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- `librosa` â€“ audio analysis and DSP
- `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`
- `soundfile` â€“ audio read/write
